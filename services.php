                <h1>Apartment Cleaning</h1>
                <p>Our cleaning system sets us apart. Our customers keep coming back to us, because we provide services that work and keep their homes and apartments clean, right down to the little details. This extensive cleaning system, which we call our Detail-Clean Rotation System, which has been proven to be effective in more than five million cleans!</p>
                <h3>How does our apartment cleaning program work?</h3>
                <p>We start with a thorough detail-clean throughout your house over the course of the first two cleans. On the first clean, our maid service will thoroughly clean your apartment, with special attention on your kitchen and bathrooms. On the second session, we’ll clean your entire apartment, but this time we’ll provide detail-clean services in your sleeping and living areas. We’ll continue to maintain this detail-clean level throughout your home throughout our next visits by providing deep cleaning services on a rotating basis.</p>
                <p>Every time we clean, we’ll provide services that include the following:</p>
